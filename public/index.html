      <h1>What is the softtennis?</h1>
      <p>
        Soft Tennis is a ball game that originated in modern tennis and
        developed in the very early stages, in which players play 2-on-2 (4
        players) or 1-on-1 (2 players) against each other with a hollow, soft
        rubber ball and a racket over a net. The game originated in Japan and is
        played mainly in East Asia, but in recent years tournaments are also
        regularly held in Eastern Europe.

      <h1>My experience in soft tennis</h1>
      <p>
        I discovered soft tennis when I was in junior high school. The reason
        for my encounter was a club activity at school. I had always liked
        tennis, but I did not know about soft tennis. I started playing soft
        tennis as a club activity, and I fell in love with the sport and was
        selected as a regular member of the school team.

      <h1>Difference between soft tennis and tennis, I feel.</h1>
      <p>
        I like both tennis and soft tennis, and although they are the same, the
        two sports are quite different. First, the speed of the ball hit is
        different. This is caused by the difference in the balls, but the tennis
        ball is faster and bounces better. Soft tennis is not as fast and does
        not bounce as much. These differences change the strategy for scoring
        points and the way the ball is hit. I prefer soft tennis because I can
        hit the ball as hard as I can.
